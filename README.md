This is an application designed to give you a "birds eye view" of your classroom allowing you to view and manage your
students' computer usage. This project was *inspired* by Lenovo's project LanSchool, for use within my own school, where
the version of LanSchool that my school has a license for does not work on Windows 11 (our computers got an upgrade).
